bravenewsector_part1_representative1 | Greetings Captain. What you've found could prove to be very useful to the Stargate project. | 
bravenewsector_part1_representative2 | Since you've used our Stargate to reach the new sector, we believe it's only fair that you assist us with researching the uses of the new resources. | 
bravenewsector_part1_representative3 | Your co-operation has been paramount in the project's sucess so far, and it must continue until the project is complete. | 
bravenewsector_part1_representative4 | Thank you, Captain. We will be in touch when you have completed your research. | 
bravenewsector_part1_representative5 | Hello again, Captain. | 
bravenewsector_part1_representative6 | The results of your research are very promising, and we'd like you to send us some refined samples of the new resources. | 
bravenewsector_part1_representative7 | We expect a shipment of Neubidium ingots and the stabilised Zeleon gas. | 
bravenewsector_part1_representative8 | Thank you for your co-operation, Captain. |

bravenewsector_part1_x1 | Captain? Are you there? | 
bravenewsector_part1_x2 | I can't believe it, the Stargate worked! This is my greatest project, my greatest achievement, perhaps my final one too. Maybe I'll have the chance to see the new sector for myself one day. | 
bravenewsector_part1_x3 | I believe this is only the beginning though, the Andromeda Project have made it clear they want to reach a new galaxy, not just a new sector. I'm sure they will be in contact soon about the next steps of the Stargate. | 
bravenewsector_part1_x4 | Thank you Captain, for all your hard work. Goodbye for now. | 
bravenewsector_part2_harken_1 | Captain, our sector scan has found new systems. They contain shipyards that are currently being operated by pirates. | 
bravenewsector_part2_harken_10 | That's all from me Captain, good luck. | 
bravenewsector_part2_harken_2 | Their exterior wear leads us to believe that they have been here for at least a century. This sector must have been one of mankind's first attempts to colonise outer-space. | 
bravenewsector_part2_harken_2 | Their exterior wear leads us to believe that have been here for at least a century. This sector must have been one of mankind's first attempts to colonise outer-space. | 
bravenewsector_part2_harken_3 | There are signs of a massive galactic war in this sector, with derelict ship signals appearing all across our sector map. | 
bravenewsector_part2_harken_4 | The aftermath of the war resulted in pirates gaining control of the sector for themselves. They have since been living here, dormant, surviving from the resources harvested in local asteroid belts and nebulas. | 
bravenewsector_part2_harken_6 | Destroying the fortresses would allow us to set up friendly shipyards and take back control of the sector from the pirates. | 
bravenewsector_part2_harken_7 | Be prepared to be met with heavy resistance if you choose to visit them. I have added their positions to your sector map. | 
bravenewsector_part2_harken_8 | There's a shuttle on the way to L*X with surveying equipment on-board. It will allow you to scan the area around your ship. | 
bravenewsector_part2_harken_9 | The forgotten battlefields of the sector may contain new research opportunities, I'd recommend that you explore any derelict ships you detect. |

bravenewsector_part2_surveywarning | There's a shuttle on the way to L*X with surveying equipment on-board. The equipment can only be used in the new sector, so you'll need to send a ship through the Stargate to start surveying. |

bravenewsector_part2_x1 | Hello again Captain, the Andromeda Project is very impressed with the samples you've sent them. They want your work on the Stargate to continue. | 
bravenewsector_part2_x3 | I must warn you, there are rumours that their plan is to take the Stargate fully under their control. They will charge anyone who wants to use it a fortune, preventing any competition and harvesting all the resources in the new galaxy for themselves. They will become more powerful than any entity we have seen before. | 
bravenewsector_part2_x4 | Please don't let that happen Captain. So much of my life and so many of my projects have been done purely for profit, I can't let this become one of them. The Stargate is too important and valuable for our species to be under their control. | 
bravenewsector_part2_x5 | I have installed a back-door that will cause the Stargate to self-destruct if you command it to. You must trigger it if the rumours are true. | 
bravenewsector_part2_x6 | Unfortunately, I've been given some bad news, and I won't be around for much longer. I would like to give you full ownership of the foundry as a thank you for helping me finish this final project. | 
bravenewsector_part2_x7 | It seems we have completed it just in time. | 
bravenewsector_part2_x8 | This is our final call, Captain. I wish you the best of luck. Thank you again, and goodbye. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_1a | Captain? Is that you? What are you doing here? It's so good to see you! | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_1b | Greetings Captain, the Andromeda Project have hired me to work on synthesising crystals produced by a creature I discovered. I've named them tiddlets. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_2a | The Andromeda Project have hired me to work on synthesising the tiddlet crystals that we discovered during our research, and I see they've sent you to provide me with the zeleon. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_2b | Upon death, a crystal is formed at the core of the tiddlet. My job is to find a way to produce these crystals without having to farm any tiddlets in the process. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_3a | I see you're looking after those tiddlets well! A lot has changed since the tiddlet farm explosion. They are a protected species now and harming them is strictly prohibited. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_3b | The neubidium and zeleon you discovered could be key to my research. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_4a | A lot has changed since the tiddlet farm explosion. They are a protected species now and harming them is strictly prohibited. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_5a | One moment Captain, I've sent a shuttle to receive the resources from you. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_5b | Unfortunately, it looks like you don't have the resources I need for my experiment, when you have the required amount come back and I'll retrieve them from you. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_6 | Great! That should be all the resources I need. I'll run the experiments and call you back when I'm done. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_7 | Speak to you soon, Captain! | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_results_1 | Hello Captain! I have incredible results. Using a highly powered zeleon laser we can charge synthetic crystals made of Neubidium to achieve properties similar to that of the tiddlet crystals. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_results_3 | This is a fantastic breakthrough but I must warn you that the laser is incredibly radioactive, and will very quickly kill your crew if you don't correctly contain its radiation. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_results_4 | Come back to my system and I'll send you one of my lasers along with some radiation blockers to keep your crew safe. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_results_5 | The next step is to research how this all applies to the Stargate. My hypothesis is that we can use the crystal's energy-density properties to enable jumps much farther than the next sector. | 
bravenewsector_part3_artemis_results_6 | Good luck with your research, Captain. |

bravenewsector_part3_intro_rep1 | Hello again, Captain. Congratulations on completing the latest phase of the Stargate project! We are all very impressed by your commitment and dedication. | 
bravenewsector_part3_intro_rep2 | The project has a new task for you. One of our scientists is investigating a new lifeform called tiddlets. | 
bravenewsector_part3_intro_rep3 | Upon death, a crystal is formed at the core of the tiddlet. This crystal has extraordinary energy density, which is exactly what we need to increase the hyperspace range of the Stargate. | 
bravenewsector_part3_intro_rep4 | The Andromeda Project would love to relentlessly farm these tiddlets, but due to recent accidents they have become a strictly protected species. The scientist you're going to visit is researching how to ethically produce their crystals. He believes the new sector's resources will be a breakthrough for his research. | 
bravenewsector_part3_intro_rep5 | Visit him and provide him a sample of the zeleon. |
