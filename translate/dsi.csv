dsi_part1_advert1 | My name is Alexander James Elistar, and I'm the chairman and founder of A.J.E Industries.  I have a business proposition for you.  If you would be interested in setting up a production facility for me, I believe with some luck and a good deal of hard work we can both make substantial returns. | 
dsi_part1_advert2 | Please give me a call to discuss the details. | 
dsi_part1_call1 | Captain.  Perhaps you are already aware, but there are big plans underway within this sector.  There are designs to build something... incredible, a transportation system with near infinite range, requiring state of the art manufacturing and industry. | 
dsi_part1_call2 | A stargate, big enough for our most massive fleets, shuttling humanity between galaxies as if they were nothing but neighbouring stars.  A new multi-galactic era for humanity. | 
dsi_part1_call3 | In all my years I've never known so much capital to be allocated to one project. | 
dsi_part1_call4 | There is a golden opportunity here for us, but the barriers to entry are high.  I have the assets, the capital, and the facilities that we need to fulfil the Andromeda Project's massive ambitions. | 
dsi_part1_call5 | Sadly, my days of running the shop floor in person are long behind me.  I need a floor manager, somebody who will oversee the day to day operations for me.  And my years of experience have taught me to spot talent when I see it. | 
dsi_part1_call6 | Here is my proposal.  I'll provide the factory station, and the seed capital so you are fully funded.  You'll set up the production facility for me, and oversee day to day operations, manufacturing parts for the Andromeda Project to their specifications. | 
dsi_part1_call7 | We'll split the profits 50/50. | 
dsi_part1_call8 | And believe me when I say, there will be plenty to go around. | 
dsi_part1_callfromrep1 | This is a message for A.J.E FOUNDRY.  We've received your samples and can report that they have passed comfortably within our engineering tolerances.  You are formally approved as licensed industry partners, and may now manufacture all items in our design manifest. | 
dsi_part1_callfromrep2 | Batches of completed parts may now be submitted to the Andromeda Project through the open Marketplace. You will find our buyers ready to release funds for any parts manufactured to specification. | 
dsi_part1_callfromrep3 | Thank you for your endeavours, and good luck. | 
dsi_part1_debrief1 | Fantastic work, Captain.  I had high expectations, but the process was even more smooth than I hoped.  We've made ourselves known to the Andromeda Project now, but this is just the beginning. | 
dsi_part1_debrief2 | The later phases of this project will no doubt be much more involved.  But we are perfectly positioned to capitalise on this opportunity.  And there is a lot of opportunity to be had. | 
dsi_part1_debrief3 | There are individuals behind this mega-project with wealth and resources far beyond my comprehension.  But their ambitions far exceed the capabilities of the other ships and people in this sector.  They are going to need our help. | 
dsi_part1_debrief4 | We can take a short break, and I'll give you a call when I'm ready to start work on the next phase of the stargate project. You might want to stop some of your equipment in the meantime, we don't want to waste anything! | 
dsi_part1_debrief5 | Goodbye for now! | 
dsi_part1_installsmelter1 | We need to tidy up the mess, but nothing needs to be wasted.  We can recycle all of the raw materials found on this station. | 
dsi_part1_installsmelter2 | There is an industrial smelter among the boxed equipment.  Install it and power it up, then set it to recycling all of the scrap metal.  This will give us an early supply of Metal Ingots.  A critical resource in manufacturing anything. | 
dsi_part1_manufactureframes1 | If I could draw your attention to this schematic issued by the Andromeda Project.  You can see it's actually quite a simple part.  This is just a structural framework, onto which they'll build everything else. | 
dsi_part1_manufactureframes2 | We can manufacture these parts in just two stages out of Metal Ingots.  I've left a boxed Fabricator and an Assembly Table on the station.  Set them up next to each other, ideally near to the Metal Ingots. | 
dsi_part1_manufactureframes3 | Once they're installed, set the Fabricator to manufacture Frames, then set the Assembly Table to specialise them into finished Stargate Frames.  It's simple stuff, but eventually we will need a huge throughput. | 
dsi_part1_manufactureframes4 | They want us to provide an initial batch of 10 Stargate Frames, for certification.  They'll inspect our work and we'll be approved as official partners in the Andromeda Project. | 
dsi_part1_manufactureframes5 | It shouldn't take too long.  If you run out of metal, remember you can recycle more of the ruined equipment around the facility. |

dsi_part1_openstargatescreen | Excellent.  Let's have a look at the Manifest that he mentioned, and see what is required next. | 
dsi_part1_payx1 | I knew this would be a very profitable endeavour for us.  The Andromeda Project are so desperately in need of reliable manufacturing facilities that they're paying a fortune. | 
dsi_part1_payx2 | Now, the sales revenue is going to flow through you.  But remember our agreement.  50/50.  I've put a lot of capital in to get us to this point, and I need to start seeing a return. | 
dsi_part1_payx3 | Every time you sell a batch of parts to the Andromeda Project, you'll owe me half the revenue.  I'd appreciate it if you'd pay promptly. | 
dsi_part1_phase2_xcall1 | It looks like it's just a bulk order of the part we already provided.  We need to make 200 more Stargate Frames.  We're already manufacturing them, but we'll need to scale up production or else this will take forever. | 
dsi_part1_phase2_xcall2 | I'm releasing some of the seed money to you.  $600,000 should be enough for you to buy all the equipment we need to scale up.  Remember this isn't a gift.  I still own this station, and all the equipment onboard. | 
dsi_part1_phase2_xcall3 | I suggest you buy more Smelters, more Fabricators, and more Assembly Tables.  A couple of each at least.  All that equipment will draw more juice, so you'll need to expand the power network with more Reactors and Batteries to cope.  And you'll need more crew to do the work. | 
dsi_part1_phase2_xcall4 | If you run out of Metal Ingots, you should be able to buy raw materials from the open Marketplace.  You can usually buy more Scrap Metal, but you'll also find Metallic Minerals for sale which can also be smelted into Metal Ingots. | 
dsi_part1_setupcall1 | Wonderful news. I'm very happy you've agreed to partner with me on this. My factory space station is in position nearby, ready for us to use as our base of operations. | 
dsi_part1_setupcall2 | This is the A.J.E Foundry.  A wonderful industrial facility, perfect for our needs.  I'll just need to provide you with some access codes so you can assume control of the facility. | 
dsi_part1_setupcall3 | Look at that.  For years I manufactured engines and FTL drives right here, for every fleet that passed through the sector.  It's really fallen into disrepair. | 
dsi_part1_setupcall4 | Your first job is to send over a skeleton crew, and establish basic power generation and life support.  I had the previous crew box up some of the usable equipment.  You should find the parts you need are already in storage. | 
dsi_part1_setupstorage1 | Efficiency is going to be the key to this facility turning a profit.  Set up a storage zone for scrap metal near to your Smelter, and another for the Metal Ingots that come out.  Our crew will waste a lot less time carrying goods long distances. |

dsi_part2_action_buyship | Buy gas fuselage | 
dsi_part2_action_takecontrol | Take control of station | 
dsi_part2_actuatorsintro1 | I propose we expand and upgrade the Station into a mining facility.  If we install Engines we can move to a rich asteroid vein, then Mining Lasers and Logistics Drones will give us the capability to harvest the raw materials we need. | 
dsi_part2_actuatorsintro2 | The Stargate Actuators are made on the Assembly Table as normal, and they require a Stargate Frame and a Motor. Motors can be made in fabricators. | 
dsi_part2_actuatorsintro3 | You'll need to mine Metallic Minerals and Copper Minerals, then melt those materials into ingots in an array of Smelters.  You can then fabricate the Motors and Frames, and finally assemble them into Stargate Actuators. | 
dsi_part2_actuatorsintro4 | I'll release some more of the seed capital to cover the costs of the upgrade, but you can take care of the details. | 
dsi_part2_actuatorsintro5 | One last thing, Captain.  I'm sure you've noticed, we aren't exactly surrounded by asteroids here.  I suggest you pair the station up with one of your FTL capable vessels, and jump them both to a suitable mining location.  You can leave the station there to do its work. | 
dsi_part2_advertisement | Captain, I think it's time we resumed work on the Stargate contract.  I've had a look ahead and the next phase is a huge step up.  Give me a call when you're ready to continue work. | 
dsi_part2_firstpartcomplete | Excellent work, Captain.  On time and to specification, as usual.  The Andromeda Project have enough of that item now, so you may as well stop production and save the energy and materials. | 
dsi_part2_introcall1 | Welcome back, Captain.  I've been taking a look at the schematics published by the Andromeda Project, and the next phase is going to need a huge upgrade to our facilities. | 
dsi_part2_introcall2 | However, nothing they're asking us to produce is impossible, and I have a strong personal interest in seeing this project completed.  The sooner the better. | 
dsi_part2_introcall3 | The Andromeda Project have released specifications for three different components.  We need to manufacture large quantities of all three to complete this phase, and each will require a different industrial setup. | 
dsi_part2_introcall4 | The first part is a Stargate Actuator.  This is something we can manufacture in our existing factory station, although it's a more complex production chain.  There won't be nearly enough resources available in the Marketplace, so we'll have to mine the local belt for minerals. | 
dsi_part2_introcall6 | The second part is a chemical compound they're calling Stargate Resin.  It's synthesised in a Chemical Lab, but we first need huge volumes of Metreon Gas.  It's found only in deep space nebulas. | 
dsi_part2_introcall7 | My thinking is to buy a suitable fuselage from a Shipyard, and then convert it into a dedicated gas capture and refining facility.  There's a good ship nearby.  You can buy it on my behalf and then set it up, and we'll drop it off in a rich gas cloud and leave it running. | 
dsi_part2_introcall8 | The final requirement is a few barrels of Stable Isotopes.  These are easily captured during routine FTL travel.  I think you can take care of this one yourself, but if necessary I can talk you through it. | 
dsi_part2_introcall9 | Time is now of the essence, Captain.  All three parts need to be produced, and I'm in more of a hurry than you may realise.  Keep me informed! | 
dsi_part2_isotopesintro1 | We need to produce 100 Stable Isotopes. This is a chemical compound we must synthesise and deliver in barrels to the Andromeda Project. | 
dsi_part2_isotopesintro2 | It's not too complex.  It starts with a Hyperspace Scoop, or several ideally, that you can fit to your vessels.  Every time you make an FTL jump you'll collect more as you pass through hyperspace.  You can then pipe those isotopes into a Refinery and convert them into Stable Isotopes. | 
dsi_part2_isotopesintro3 | The final stage is to install a Loader or two, and set them to 'UNLOAD'.  This will instruct your crew to barrel up the stable isotopes and store them in the cargo hold so you can easily sell them on the Marketplace. |

dsi_part2_resinintro1 | There is a ship for sale here that's perfect for our gas collection enterprise.  Let's buy it and add it to the fleet. | 
dsi_part2_resinintro2 | Gas collection is a slow process.  Our aim should be to place this vessel within a dense metreon nebula, slowly absorbing the gas and refining it over time.  Once we're in the nebula we won't be able to easily upgrade the ship, so we'll want to set it up as much as possible in advance. | 
dsi_part2_resinintro3 | I'll send over more seed money and you can outfit the ship as you see best. | 
dsi_part2_resinintro4 | The process of making Stargate Resin starts with a Gas Collector bringing in the Metreon Gas.  We then pipe that into a Refinery to produce Refined Metreon, then into a Chemical Lab where the Stargate Resin can be synthesised. | 
dsi_part2_resinintro5 | You'll need all of that equipment to get started.  I'd recommend Collectors, Refineries, and Chemical Labs, four each at least.  You'll also want Storage Tanks to buffer the intermediate products, and an upgrade to the Power Grid. | 
dsi_part2_resinintro6 | You may need to shop around a bit, if the local trade post doesn't have everything you need. | 
dsi_part2_resinintro7 | Once the ship is ready, pair it up with one of your FTL capable vessels, and jump into a nearby nebula to begin the process of gas collection. | 
dsi_part2_scene_x1 | There's a situation brewing at our factory in the asteroid belt.  You'd better take a look. | 
dsi_part2_scene_x2 | I'll talk to him. | 
dsi_part2_scene_x3 | Raymond.  It's been quite a while.  How have you been? | 
dsi_part2_scene_x4 | Captain, I'll take care of this.  My private security are on their way.  I'll keep him talking, but there's no need for bloodshed. | 
dsi_part2_scene_x5 | You were compensated for your work Raymond.  You signed the contract. | 
dsi_part2_scene_y1 | Is he in there?  Alexander?  Where is he? | 
dsi_part2_scene_y2 | I'm not going to ask again.  I demand to speak to Alexander Elistar.  Immediately!  I am armed! | 
dsi_part2_scene_y3 | How have I been?  You know exactly how I've been.  I'm here to collect my share. | 
dsi_part2_scene_y4 | The designs were mine.  The patents were mine!  All of this, it's all built on my work. | 
dsi_part2_scene_y5 | For pennies!  You screwed me, and now it's worth millions! | 
dsi_part2_scene_y6 | I want my share.  Deal me in.  10% ownership of this new venture of yours.  I'm being reasonable, but the law is on my side.  Don't make me shut you down Alexander. | 
dsi_part2_scene_y7 | You've left me no choice. | 
dsi_part2_scene_y8 | I'll be coming for you Alexander, and this time I'm not asking for 10%. I want it all. | 
dsi_part2_scene_z1 | This is Private Security vessel DOGMA, under exclusive contract to A.J.E Industries. | 
dsi_part2_scene_z2 | You are operating in a dangerous and threatening manner in the vicinity of an A.J.E corporate facility. |

dsi_part2_scene_z4 | We are authorised by deep space convention in the use of deadly force in defense of our client's assets. | 
dsi_part2_scene_z5 | THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER WARNING. | 
dsi_part2_secondpartcomplete1 | I'm sure you've noticed, we're making a small fortune from all of this.  Truth be told, I'm not really doing this for the revenue.  I already have more than I can ever spend.  But I'm running out of time.  The Doctors have made that clear to me. | 
dsi_part2_secondpartcomplete2 | I've been around quite a few years.  I've had my share of success, built my empire, my fortune.  I live a comfortable life.  But I find myself thinking more and more about what I want to do with the time I have left. | 
dsi_part2_secondpartcomplete3 | I just want to be the first at something huge.  The first person to visit another galaxy.  Alexander James Elistar.  That's a name that people would remember. | 
dsi_part2_summary | Resume work on the Stargate with X | 
dsi_part2_thirdpartcomplete1 | We are all done, Captain.  That was an incredible display of industrialised power.  There's nobody even close to us in the Marketplace, and we basically are the Andromeda Project.  They need us now. | 
dsi_part2_thirdpartcomplete2 | Let's take another break and I'll contact you when the Andromeda Project releases the manifest for their next phase. | 
dsi_part2_thirdpartcomplete3 | You should know that my Doctors continue to bring me bad news.  Each time I talk to them... well, I don't know how long I have left.  This will be my final project.  I just hope I have time to finish it. |

dsi_x_canceldeal1 | I'm disappointed, Captain. You're backing out after all the investment I've put into this project? | 
dsi_x_canceldeal2 | You will regret this. | 
dsi_x_canceldeal3 | Goodbye, Captain. | 
dsi_xthanks1 | Thank you, Captain.  I appreciate the prompt payment. | 
dsi_xthanks2 | Payment received, thank you, Captain. | 
dsi_xthanks3 | I've received my share.  Excellent work, Captain. | 
dsi_xwarning1 | Captain, I can see you've sold a batch of Stargate parts, but I've received no corresponding payment.  We agreed to split all revenue 50/50.  This setup is costing me a fortune and I need to start making my return.  Please transfer the funds to my account as soon as possible. | 
dsi_xwarning2 | Captain, I was sure I'd made our agreement clear.  Don't forget who owns this station, and all the equipment onboard.  50/50 was what we agreed. | 
dsi_xwarning2_part1 | Captain, I was sure I'd made our agreement clear.  Don't forget who owns this station, and all the equipment onboard.  50/50 was what we agreed. | 
dsi_xwarning2_part2 | I thought I could trust you.  Pay me the money you owe, immediately, or I will be forced to escalate. | 
dsi_xwarning3 | Captain, this is your final warning.  You are now willfully withholding sales revenue that is legally mine.  If you don't pay what you owe immediately I will have no choice but to terminate our agreement, seize control of my station, and recover any financial losses directly from you. |
