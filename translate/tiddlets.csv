tiddlets_part1_death2 | ... | 
tiddlets_part1_death3 | It looks like they died of shock during the hyperspace jump.  Oh goodness, this is such horrible news.  Did any of them survive? | 
tiddlets_part1_death4 | We'll have to be so careful from now on, Captain. I suggest a maximum hyperspace jump range of *X light years while you have these creatures on board. We can't let any more of them perish this way. | 
tiddlets_part1_deliver | DELIVER TIDDLETS | 
tiddlets_part1_delivered1 | This is the greatest day of my life! | 
tiddlets_part1_delivered2 | To be the first to discover and study an entirely new life form. One native to deep space! Think of all we can learn from these little creatures! | 
tiddlets_part1_delivered3 | I mean, you'll get some credit for finding them, of course. But I've waited my whole life for a moment like this. | 
tiddlets_part1_delivered4 | Incredible work, Captain. I can't believe how much we've seen, in such a short period of time. | 
tiddlets_part1_delivered5 | I've been analysing the onboard sensor data while you've been travelling around.  They don't exhibit any sort of physical mating behaviour, but there is a detectable energy exchange going on, and always between groups of three. | 
tiddlets_part1_delivered6 | They must be reproducing through some form of telepathy, and only in triplets, and only in hyperspace!  No wonder they're such a rare creature. | 
tiddlets_part1_delivered7 | These findings will make an incredible research paper, Captain.  I'll be sure to credit you as the pilot who found the first living specimens.  I would offer to name the creatures after you, but they already have a name, so apologies for not being able to honour that tradition. | 
tiddlets_part1_delivered8 | You'll be getting a call from Dr Swanson very soon.  He funds my lab and all of my research.  I've talked him into directing some of our research grant to you, as a fair reward. | 
tiddlets_part1_foundtiddlets1 | My gods. You've found them. | 
tiddlets_part1_foundtiddlets2 | Oh god. They're still alive?? | 
tiddlets_part1_foundtiddlets3 | Oh jesus. There's two of them! | 
tiddlets_part1_foundtiddlets4 | Captain, you've made an incredible discovery. We have seen these interstellar lifeforms before, on large asteroids deep in uncharted space. But never alive. And you've found a pair! | 
tiddlets_part1_foundtiddlets5 | We call them the Tiddlets. | 
tiddlets_part1_intro1 | What is a ship like yours doing all the way out here? | 
tiddlets_part1_intro2 | Maybe you can help?  I'm looking for creatures that usually live on small isolated asteroids, like the one in this system. | 
tiddlets_part1_intro3 | If you find anything make sure to tell me. | 
tiddlets_part1_reproduction1 | Oh god, the tiddlets!!! | 
tiddlets_part1_reproduction2 | Oh my goodness, I hope they're ok! What's happening?? | 
tiddlets_part1_reproduction3 | Are you kidding me! They've... They've reproduced! We've just witnessed an interstellar life form, spontaneously reproducing! | 
tiddlets_part1_reproduction4 | Oh this is just such incredible news. But what was the condition? Maybe these ones were already fertile and pregnant? Did you see any mating behaviours? I need to do more analysis. | 
tiddlets_part1_reproduction5 | Keep looking Captain. Bring them all back to us when you're done. | 
tiddlets_part1_sendingshuttle | You managed to bring them back? Amazing! I'll be here in a second. | 
tiddlets_part1_setup1 | I should introduce myself. My name is Artemis Toppingbury, and I'm a professor at the Institute of Interstellar Lifeforms.  We've been trying to find a live Tiddlet for years now. | 
tiddlets_part1_setup2 | This is a massive breakthrough. Bring the Tiddlets on board, carefully, using a Logistics Drone. Once you have them, meet me at the Institute for Interstellar Lifeforms.  We're at Starbase S*X. | 
tiddlets_part1_setup3 | Now we know where to look, we may be able to find more of them in deep space. | 
tiddlets_part1_setup4 | The asteroid where you found them has a large iron and aluminium core, with some unusual crystalline structures on the outside. | 
tiddlets_part1_setup5 | There are similar asteroids within this sector that have been recorded and scanned.  Nobody would bother trying to mine such worthless rocks. They might not have looked too closely. | 
tiddlets_part1_setup6 | I think it's worth searching there for more of these creatures. | 
tiddlets_part1_swanson1 | Captain. On behalf of the Institute for Interstellar Life, thank you. A monumental discovery. | 
tiddlets_part1_swanson2 | Now let's talk real. Scientists like Artemis like to take all the credit, and bask in the glory of their peers. If your name does show up in their research paper, you can bet it will be on the very last page, in the smallest font available. | 
tiddlets_part1_swanson3 | And despite funding his work for years now, my name will be even lower. It's fine really. We have different aims.  He can have the glory. I'm interested in the breakthroughs. The science that comes from these discoveries. The potential. | 
tiddlets_part1_swanson4 | Anyway, thank you for your work, Captain. Here's a reward for your efforts. | 
tiddlets_part1_tiddletdelivery | Deliver Tiddlets | 
tiddlets_part1_title | The Trouble with Tiddlets | 
tiddlets_part2_advert | Captain. We're hoping to run some more experiments on the new life form I discovered. The Toppingbury Tiddlet. If you could visit my institute, I have a contract that may be of interest to you. | 
tiddlets_part2_debrief1 | We've made another interesting discovery!  Our sensors were correct, and it appears some type of tiny crystal has been formed at the core of several of the dead creatures.  Almost like a small diamond. | 
tiddlets_part2_debrief2 | It must have formed in the final moments of their life. All that telepathic energy, focussed into a lethal feedback loop!  Our lab tells us the crystals aren't like anything they've ever seen before.  Let's get the remaining samples in for analysis. | 
tiddlets_part2_debrief3 | Thank you, Captain! | 
tiddlets_part2_finalexperiment1 | *X Tiddlets now on board!  Fascinating, Captain.  It appears the Tiddlet reproductive process occurs even at incredibly short hyperspace distances.\nHow do they find the time? | 
tiddlets_part2_finalexperiment2 | I'll hand you over to my colleague for the final experiment. | 
tiddlets_part2_finalexperiment3 | Captain, the Professor has asked me to oversee this phase of the experiment. | 
tiddlets_part2_finalexperiment4 | I need you to make a long range jump. Beyond the safe tiddlet distance.  We need to know what happens to them under the effects of Hyperspace Shock, and this will also help us to calculate that safe distance more accurately. | 
tiddlets_part2_finalexperiment5 | Get into position and make the long range jump. | 
tiddlets_part2_long | LONG HOP DISTANCE | 
tiddlets_part2_medium | MEDIUM HOP DISTANCE | 
tiddlets_part2_mediumjumps1 | Let's start simple. A couple of medium range hops should do the trick. | 
tiddlets_part2_mediumjumps2 | Excellent. The sensor is working nicely and we are receiving science packets. Let's do one more medium range hop to gather some more data. | 
tiddlets_part2_objective_ftlcharges | Have at least *X FTL fuel | 
tiddlets_part2_objective_installsensors | Install Sensor Stations [*X/*Y] | 
tiddlets_part2_objective_longjump | Make a jump longer than the Tiddlet safe distance | 
tiddlets_part2_objective_mediumjumps | Perform medium range hops [*X/*Y] | 
tiddlets_part2_objective_receivesensors | Receive [*X/*Y] Telepathic Sensor Stations | 
tiddlets_part2_objective_receivetiddlets | Receive [*X/*Y] Tiddlets | 
tiddlets_part2_objective_return1 | Return the Tiddlets to the Institute | 
tiddlets_part2_objective_return2 | Return the bodies to the Institute | 
tiddlets_part2_objective_shortjump | Perform a short range hop | 
tiddlets_part2_objective_visitinstitute | Travel to the Institute for Interstellar Lifeforms | 
tiddlets_part2_return1 | *X of the Tiddlets appear to have perished. | 
tiddlets_part2_return2 | That's such a horrible thing to witness.\nWe can't allow this sort of experiment to be done again, doctor. It's so unethical. | 
tiddlets_part2_return3 | The sensor data suggests the telepathic mating ritual does begin during the longer jump.  But the telepathic energy induced between them produces so much heat at their core that they ultimately catch fire and burn out from the inside. | 
tiddlets_part2_return4 | One can only imagine what that must feel like. | 
tiddlets_part2_return5 | There's something else.  There's a reading showing up on the sensors, deep inside the core of the dead tiddlets.\nBring them all back to me, Captain. I think we've done enough for today. | 
tiddlets_part2_setup1 | Welcome back, Captain! I must say, the corridors at the Institute have been alive with excitement over this wondrous new lifeform. My paper has already been provisionally accepted into all the top nature journals, which makes me so proud. | 
tiddlets_part2_setup2 | The word on the grapevine is that the Nobel prize committee may be looking at our work. | 
tiddlets_part2_setup3 | Exactly. So we must continue this important research. We have a great deal of data already, but we need to take some more measurements and refine some of our estimates. We are particularly interested in their reproductive process. | 
tiddlets_part2_setup4 | We're going to send you a batch of Toppingbury Tiddlets, and we want you to run a series of tests on them under Hyperspace conditions. | 
tiddlets_part2_setup5 | We're also sending you a pair of specially modified science stations, with a sensor attuned to their telepathic reproductive process. I wrote the firmware myself. We will be able to see deep into their minds when this magical process takes place. | 
tiddlets_part2_setup6 | We need you to take the tiddlets on a series of specific hyperspace jumps. We will be recording the effect on their reproductive process and on their physiology. All... well, most of these experiments can be done hopefully without any harm coming to the creatures. | 
tiddlets_part2_setup7 | We need to zero in on exactly how long the Tiddlets can survive in hyperspace. This will regrettably require you to jump beyond the safe distance, and to record the effect on their telepathic process. Some of the Tiddlets may be lost in the process of this experiment. | 
tiddlets_part2_setup8 | That does make me quite uncomfortable. | 
tiddlets_part2_setup9 | But with your permission, we can begin. Install the new sensors first, Captain. And be sure to stock up on FTL fuel if you need to. Three or four jumps ought to be enough. | 
tiddlets_part2_short | SHORT HOP DISTANCE | 
tiddlets_part2_shortjump1 | *X Tiddlets so far.  This is all working very well, Captain.  Now onto the real science. | 
tiddlets_part2_shortjump2 | We'd like to see the effect of a very short hop.  We want to know if there is a minimum hyperspace distance, below which their reproductive process simply does not occur.  Make the jump and let's see how they do. |

tiddlets_part3_advert | Captain, there have been several developments with the Tiddlet Research Program. We are in need of a competent starship pilot once again.  Please visit us at the Institute for Interstellar lifeforms and I can tell you more. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_arrival1 | Captain, thank Goodness.  Are they all safe? | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_arrival2 | Quickly, before they figure out what's happening.  I'll override the remote transceiver on the farm ship.  For a few minutes we'll be able to control it ourselves. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_arrival3 | Long enough to put an end to this horror show.  Take the ship over to the asteroid.  Open the docking bay doors. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_debrief1 | You did the right thing, Captain.  That matters, to me at least. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_debrief2 | I wouldn't worry too much about the threat.  He knows he's operating completely illegally.  There's no way the charter of deep space life permits this kind of action. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_debrief3 | As for the Tiddlets, the Doctor is sure to return and try to capture more.  I'll do my best to keep them safe from him, for as long as I can. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_debrief4 | You may as well keep the rescue ship.  You could sell it if you need to raise some funds. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_debrief5 | I'll be in touch if I need your help, Captain. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_finalobjective1 | Captain, this is wrong.  You know it is. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_finalobjective2 | Please don't do this.  These creatures deserve more than to be battery farmed and slaughtered. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_finalobjective3 | My clearances have all been revoked.  They've shut me out completely.  It's up to you, but please make the right choice. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_finalobjective4 | I'm hiding out in system S*X.  It's where you found the first Tiddlets, near that unusual asteroid.  Bring them here, and be careful not to risk Hyperspace shock. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_finalobjective5 | We're going to set them all free. | 
tiddlets_part3_artemis_finalplea1 | Captain, please don't do this! | 
tiddlets_part3_batteryfarm | Yes!  I knew this would work!  We can battery farm the tiddlets, in huge quantities, right here in this system!  Keep going.  We need more! |

tiddlets_part3_brokenhopdrive1 | It looks like that last jump fried the hop drive.  Not great, given what we paid for it. | 
tiddlets_part3_brokenhopdrive2 | No matter.  I'm certain my engineers can repair it.  In any case, I want the hop drive to be installed on the farm ship directly. | 
tiddlets_part3_brokenhopdrive3 | Dismantle the Hop Drive, Captain, and I'll send a shuttle to collect it.  I want you to replace the Hop Drive with a conventional FTL drive, for the final part of the experiment.  I'll send a replacement FTL drive in the delivery shuttle. |

tiddlets_part3_martinez_a1 | Captain! It's so good to hear from you again.  How have you been? | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_a2 | We've been taking some time to recover.  I must admit, I spent so long planning my brother's rescue, I almost don't know what to do with myself. | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_a3 | I've put the rescue ship up for sale. I was asking $1M, but you can have it for half that price if you like.  Thank you, Captain.  You'll always be welcome with us. | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_b1 | Hello, Captain.  How have you been? Things have been tough here. | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_b2 | Marcus has been in and out of hospital since the rescue.  He has burns all over his body, and took quite a serious dose of radiation. | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_b3 | Of course, you already know that, because it happened while he was uploading your data. | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_b4 | I hope it was worth it for you, Captain. | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_b5 | The ship is up for sale.  I can't bear to be on-board any longer.  The price is $1M.  But I suppose you did help to build the hop drive, so I'll let you have it for $800k. | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_c1 | Why are you here? | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_c2 | Ten years I worked on his rescue.  Ten years. | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_c3 | Do you know what it's like to die from radiation poisoning?  No?  I do.  Since your rescue attempt I've watched it happen.  Hair falls out, organ failure rips through the body.  Vomiting.  Sick and blood.  For days on end. | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_c4 | They wouldn't even let me near him. | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_c5 | You did that to him, Captain. | 
tiddlets_part3_martinez_c6 | I don't want to talk to you, Captain.  Yes, the ship is for sale.  Take it.  I don't ever want to see that ship, or you, again.  Do not call me again. |

tiddlets_part3_objective_visitinstitute | Travel to the Institute for Interstellar Lifeforms | 
tiddlets_part3_setup1 | The work continues, Captain. There is so much more to these Tiddlets than we realised. | 
tiddlets_part3_setup10 | So, onto business.  There is a scientist by the name of Dr. Julian Martinez in a nearby system. He had a moment of fame recently after a daring rescue of his brother.  He has a ship for sale that we believe will be of some use. | 
tiddlets_part3_setup11 | Travel to the noble Doctor and buy his ship. He wants a million credits, which is ridiculous.  He thinks his invention is worth that much.  Negotiate with him, knock that price down, and I'll wire the funds directly to him.  If you can improve his offer then I'll pay you 20% of the savings as a bonus. | 
tiddlets_part3_setup2 | Regrettably, Professor Toppingbury has been forced to take a leave of absence.  From the stress of his work, you understand. | 
tiddlets_part3_setup3 | We know how they reproduce now, and we know their limits. During hyperspace travel, 3 of them will telepathically reproduce. | 
tiddlets_part3_setup4 | We're not quite sure yet how long it takes for their children to grow up. However, we've noticed they hop at exactly the same time their parents do. | 
tiddlets_part3_setup5 | This isn't important, but I thought you might find it amusing. | 
tiddlets_part3_setup6 | As you've already seen, they experience hyperspace shock if they've been in hyperspace travel for too long. | 
tiddlets_part3_setup7 | But the key is in the final stage of their life-cycle.  We know if we expose them to hyperspace shock, their telepathic energies are so strong that a small crystal is formed in their final moments. | 
tiddlets_part3_setup8 | We've been studying the crystals we've recovered so far.  They resonate in subspace in a way we've never seen before.  Some of the crystals are entangled at the quantum level, and resonate together.  Apply a signal to one and another responds, instantly, across any distance. | 
tiddlets_part3_setup9 | There are so many potential applications. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_a1 | Incredible work, Captain. I'm not sure how you managed that, but I'm true to my word.  I'll wire the funds to Dr. Martinez, with a sales bonus of $100k for you.  Bring the ship back to the Institute, and let's put it to use. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_b1 | Good work, Captain. That's a good price.  I'll send the funds to Dr Martinez.  You've earned a sales bonus of $40k.  Bring the ship back to the Institute, and let's put it to use. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_c1 | Very disappointing, Captain.  You'll need to do better if you want to succeed out here.  This ship is costing us an arm and a leg. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_c2 | I'll send the funds to Dr. Martinez now.  Bring the ship back to the Institute, and we can begin work. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefa1 | Well done, Captain.  Everything has worked exactly as I predicted, and we now have an excellent harvest on the farm ship.  More importantly, you've shown the way. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefa2 | I think I can take it from here, Captain.  My engineers tell me they'll have the Hop Drive fitted to the farm ship in just a few days.  In fact, we are close to automating the entire Tiddlet Harvest process with this one ship. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefa3 | I knew we could rely on you, Captain.  Thank you for showing the highest degrees of professionalism. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefa4 | As for the rescue ship, we don't need it anymore.  It was the Hop Drive we wanted.  You can keep it if you want, or sell it. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefa5 | I'll be in touch if your services are required in the future. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefb1 | Captain, we lost contact with our ship for a second.  Where are you?  You seem to have gone completely off course. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefb2 | My God.  What have you done? | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefb3 | Where are they?  Where are my Tiddlets?? | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefb4 | Mark my words, Captain.  You will bitterly regret crossing me. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_debriefb5 | Grand Larceny, Property Damage, Fraud, Sabotage.  I'll see to it you spend the next decade in space prison for this.  You and that Professor. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_finalobjective1 | This is it, Captain. We stand on the verge of a massive achievement.  Can you imagine how many crystals we can produce, in just one jump?  There could be hundreds.  The research potentials are staggering. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_finalobjective2 | You know what to do, Captain.  A couple of very long jumps ought to be enough.  Bring them all back to me when it's done. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_random1 | Yes! | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_random2 | More! | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_random3 | Keep going! | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_random4 | Again! | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_return1 | Our plan is simple, Captain.  We found during your excellent field work that the Tiddlets will still reproduce, even with an incredibly short FTL jump. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_return2 | The ship you just purchased has a specially modified FTL Hop Drive.  We can use it to make very short jumps and trigger the hyperspace reproductive process among the Tiddlets. | 
tiddlets_part3_swanson_return3 | We want you to pair the Hop Drive ship with our Tiddlet Farm vessel, and activate the short range hop drive.  You won't even need to leave the system.  If our calculations are correct, we should see an instant result. | 
tiddlets_part3_title | The Trouble with Tiddlets, Part 3 | 
tiddlets_part4_advert | This is Dr Swanson at the Institute for Interstellar Lifeforms. I'm declaring an emergency. We need urgent assistance. Our ship is compromised. Please, to any vessel nearby, we need emergency rescue. Many lives are at stake. |

tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis_a1 | I want to thank you for helping, Captain, when it counted. For doing the right thing. I'll split the remaining grant money I have with you. You deserve it. | 
tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis_a2 | One last thing.  I couldn't help but notice you've picked up a couple of Tiddlets, along with the scientists you rescued. I wouldn't worry - two is a very safe number. | 
tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis_a3 | But I'd recommend you never bring a third aboard.  Look after them, Captain. I know you will. | 
tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis_b1 | I thought Dr Swanson was my ally. And I thought I could trust you. But you both put money before everything else. I don't know how you can live like that. | 
tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis_b2 | You've one last chance to make things right. It looks like a couple of Tiddlets found their way onboard with the scientists you rescued. Two is probably safe, but never bring a third aboard. | 
tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis_b3 | I suggest you look after them from now on, Captain. It won't atone for the things you've done, but it's a start. | 
tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis1 | I tried to stop him. Tried to warn him. | 
tiddlets_part4_debrief_artemis2 | Captain, these recent events have made me reconsider my role in all of this. These creatures need our protection. They need somebody to look out for them. | 
tiddlets_part4_debrief_swanson1 | Thank God. |
