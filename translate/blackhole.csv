blackhole_part1_completion1 | Thank you, Captain. I now have what I need to modify this FTL drive for the Short Range Hop. | 
blackhole_part1_completion2 | It's going to take me some time to prepare the calculations.  Leave things to me and I'll call you when we're ready for the next phase. | 
blackhole_part1_hintisotopes1 | Looks like you have a Hyperspace Scoop!  You can use this to gather the Hyperspace Isotopes I need. | 
blackhole_part1_hintisotopes2 | You'll need to install the Scoop facing forward on the front of your ship, then connect its pipe output to a storage tank. | 
blackhole_part1_hintisotopes3 | The Scoop works only when you are in hyperspace. So you'll need to gather the isotopes over a few FTL jumps. | 
blackhole_part1_hintunloading1 | You've collected some Hyperspace Isotopes in a tank! You'll need to pump them into Containers so we can easily move them between ships. | 
blackhole_part1_hintunloading2 | Buy a LOADER from any trade post and install it near your Hyperspace Isotope tanks. Connect the pipes, and set the loader to 'UNLOAD'. | 
blackhole_part1_hintunloading3 | You should also designate some storage space for the Isotope containers. | 
blackhole_part1_intro1 | Greetings Captain. My name is Dr. Martinez and I'm reaching out to ask for your help. | 
blackhole_part1_intro2 | For years now my brother and I have been studying the high energy particle emissions in orbit of the black hole you can see behind us.  Its official designation is Qz247 - the collapsed remnants of a star that lived a couple of billion years ago. | 
blackhole_part1_intro3 | An accident with our equipment has left my brother in dire need of a rescue, and I need your help. | 
blackhole_part1_return1 | You've gathered the materials I need! Bring them back to me at Qz247 to complete the contract. | 
blackhole_part1_sendingshuttle | I'm sending a shuttle to you now, Captain. Get your crew to load the Hyperspace Isotopes for me. | 
blackhole_part1_setup2 | Thank you for offering your services, Captain. | 
blackhole_part1_setup3 | The Stargate project funded our research from the beginning.  They buy all the data we can collect, and the closer we travel to the event horizon, the more data our sensors receive. Every mission, we'd push ourselves to go closer. | 
blackhole_part1_setup4 | The last time, we pushed it too far.  My brother Marcus took the sensor ship and flew closer than we've ever been before.  Right to the edge.  Closer than anyone has ever been. | 
blackhole_part1_setup5 | I've lost all contact, and he's been down there for a long time now.  He's still showing on the sensors, and his ship is still intact.  The gravitational forces and time dilation will be extreme.  But with your help, we're going to rescue him. | 
blackhole_part1_setup6 | There's only one way to get to him without falling into the black hole ourselves.  We're going to have to do an extremely short range HYPERSPACE HOP. | 
blackhole_part1_setup6b | Using a modified FTL Drive you'll do one hyperspace hop toward the black hole, rescue my brother Marcus, then turn around and hop right out.  It will be dangerous, but it's the only way to avoid being dragged in ourselves. | 
blackhole_part1_setup7 | I need materials to synthesise the resources we need.  You can help me with this, while I work on the calculations. I'll need Hyperspace Isotopes - you should be able to collect them easily enough, but you'll need to acquire a Hyperspace Scoop first. | 
blackhole_part1_setup7b | You'll then need to use a Loader to start unloading the isotopes into containers. | 
blackhole_part1_setup8 | I'm building the Hyperspace FTL drive that will allow you to perform the hop.  It's going to need some modifications.  I'll need you to manufacture some parts for me. I know you have manufacturing facilities near the Stargate project.  You should be able to make these parts for me without too much trouble. | 
blackhole_part1_setup9 | Bring those materials back to me, and we can move onto phase 2. | 
blackhole_part1_title | Black Hole Sun | 
blackhole_part2_finished1 | Excellent work, Captain.  I'll begin synthesising the FTL charges immediately.  It will take me a little while. | 
blackhole_part2_finished2 | I know the Stargate Project have been in touch and I know they want their data.  I get that, but let's remember the priority is safely recovering my brother.  Sometimes they take people for granted. | 
blackhole_part2_finished3 | I'll contact you when I'm ready to begin the rescue. | 
blackhole_part2_intro1 | Captain.  My modifications to the FTL Drive are now complete.  We are ready now for phase 2 of my brother's rescue. | 
blackhole_part2_intro2 | Please come and see me and I'll explain what I need from you. | 
blackhole_part2_objective_dock | Dock with Julian Martinez | 
blackhole_part2_objective_dronebay | Receive Drone Bay | 
blackhole_part2_objective_drones | Receive Logistics Drone | 
blackhole_part2_objective_lasers | Receive 2x Mining Lasers | 
blackhole_part2_objective_mine | Mine Tilium Ore [*X/*Y] | 
blackhole_part2_objective_refine | Refine Tilium Crystals [*X/*Y] | 
blackhole_part2_objective_return | Return the Tilium Crystals to Dr. Martinez [*X/*Y] | 
blackhole_part2_objective_smelter | Receive 1x Smelter | 
blackhole_part2_objective_totilium | Travel to an asteroid belt with Tilium deposits | 
blackhole_part2_return1 | It looks like you have enough Tilium Crystals.  Bring the Tilium Crystals back to me to close the contract. | 
blackhole_part2_return2 | I'll send the shuttle to collect the Tilium Crystals. Thank you, Captain! | 
blackhole_part2_setup1 | Captain. Thanks for coming. | 
blackhole_part2_setup2 | I've completed work on the modified FTL drive, using those radioactive hyperspace isotopes you provided. | 
blackhole_part2_setup3 | With this FTL drive you'll be capable of performing an extremely short range FTL Hop in close proximity to the black hole.  You'll emerge directly on top of my twin brother's ship, and perform the rescue. | 
blackhole_part2_setup4 | You'll need to make two jumps - one in and one out.  I've checked and double checked the calculations.  I'll need your help to make two FTL charges that work with the modified FTL Hop Drive. | 
blackhole_part2_setup5 | I'll need quite a lot of Tilium Crystals for the FTL charges.  Tilium ore can be mined from just about any asteroid belt in the system - but you will need a Mining Laser to do it, and Drones to collect the mineral. | 
blackhole_part2_setup6 | You'll then need a Smelter to process the ore into Tilium Crystals.  I have most of the equipment you'll need here.  If you dock with my ship I can send it over. | 
blackhole_part2_setup7 | Take those Mining Lasers and the drones and find an asteroid belt with some Tilium deposits.  Point the mining lasers at the Tilium and use the drones to collect the mineral. | 
blackhole_part2_setup8 | Once you've mined the resource you'll need to refine it into Tilium Crystals using the Smelter I've provided. | 
blackhole_part2_stargate0 | Greetings, Captain.  I'm a representative of the Stargate Project. | 
blackhole_part2_stargate1 | We heard about your involvement with the Martinez rescue mission and we wanted to offer our support.  The twins have been hugely important to the project from the beginning, and the data they have provided has enabled many of our biggest advancements. | 
blackhole_part2_stargate2 | When the accident occurred, the younger twin Marcus was collecting vital data on black hole Qz247.  Data that is simply impossible to acquire by any other means.  Data that we need to complete the Stargate. | 
blackhole_part2_stargate3 | Their entire operation is funded by us. So I'm sure you believe us when we say that their safe rescue is very important to us - but just as important is the recovery of the data that remains trapped on Marcus' stricken vessel. | 
blackhole_part2_stargate4 | We see no reason why you can't rescue both Marcus and the critical science data at the same time. If you can recover our data during the rescue, we will pay a substantial bonus. | 
blackhole_part2_stargate5 | Think it over.  We'll be in touch. |

blackhole_part3_finalscene1 | Marcus, thank God. | 
blackhole_part3_finalscene2 | What took you so long? I was down there for hours! | 
blackhole_part3_finalscene3 | Wait, how long has it been? | 
blackhole_part3_finalscene4 | You were so close to the event horizon. The temporal distortion was huge.  I've been working on your rescue for a long time Marcus. | 
blackhole_part3_finalscene5 | How long? | 
blackhole_part3_finalscene6 | You've been down there for 10 years. | 
blackhole_part3_finalscene7 | ...! | 
blackhole_part3_marcus1 | I was beginning to think you wouldn't be coming!  I've been down here for hours! | 
blackhole_part3_marcus2 | Dock your ship with mine, Captain, and tell me when you're ready for me to come on board.  Please hurry! | 
blackhole_part3_marcusdata1 | The Stargate data?  I can send that, Captain, but you'll have to give me a few minutes to access the data and set up the transmission. | 
blackhole_part3_marcusdata2 | Damn it Captain, I don't have time for that!  I don't know how much longer the ship is going to survive like this.  I'll do my best, but you'd better be ready. | 
blackhole_part3_marcusrescue1 | I'm onboard, Captain.  Get us out of here! | 
blackhole_part3_marcuswarning1 | My ship is falling apart from the gravitional forces, Captain.  I've sent the data that I can.  Please hurry and get me off this ship! | 
blackhole_part3_marcuswarning2 | The reactor containment has failed, Captain.  The cabin is being flooded with radiation.  You have to get me out of here! |

blackhole_part3_outcomea1 | I'm just glad you're safe. | 
blackhole_part3_outcomea2 | Thank you so much, Captain. I couldn't have succeeded without your help. I'm so grateful you took my call and were here for us when we needed you. | 
blackhole_part3_outcomea3 | Here's your payment, and a little bonus. | 
blackhole_part3_outcomeb1 | It was really close.  I can't believe the risk the Captain made you take for that data.  You could easily have been killed. | 
blackhole_part3_outcomeb2 | Captain, I spent the best part of a decade planning this rescue.  I don't appreciate you risking it all at the crucial moment.  I didn't think you'd take that kind of risk with his life. | 
blackhole_part3_outcomeb3 | Thank you for your efforts. The contract is closed. | 
blackhole_part3_outcomec1 | Jesus, Marcus! Get the medical team in here now! | 
blackhole_part3_outcomec2 | What did you do Captain? Why did it take you so long to bring him on board? For what, for some data? | 
blackhole_part3_outcomec3 | His RAD badge is black.  He's been massively irradiated.  How could you do this to us?  I trusted you with this! | 
blackhole_part3_setup1 | Everything is ready, Captain.  I've produced the Hyperspace Modulators and the FTL fuel is already loaded. | 
blackhole_part3_setup2 | You'll be performing the rescue using my ship, using my modified FTL drive that is already installed onboard. You can take control of my ship when you are ready to begin the rescue. | 
blackhole_part3_setup3 | This has been a long time coming, Captain.  I've been working on this rescue for years.  Time dilation effects from the Black Hole mean that only a few hours will have passed for my brother.  It will be a surprise to him just how much time has passed when you bring him out. | 
blackhole_part3_setup4 | Let's run over the plan one last time.  You're going to perform an incredibly short range Hyperspace Hop, and you'll emerge directly on top of my brother's ship.  Dock with his ship, rescue him and then get out of there.  Hop in, Rescue, Hop out. | 
blackhole_part3_setup5 | Once you take control of my ship, you'll find the location of Marcus' ship programmed into your Sector Map.  You will be jumping directly toward the black hole.  You should expect turbulance. | 
blackhole_part3_setup6 | You won't have long.  Be as quick as you can and jump out of there when you're done. | 
blackhole_part3_setup7 | Good luck, Captain. I'll see you on the other side. | 
blackhole_part3_stargate1 | Greetings, Captain.  Good luck with the rescue.  Remember the data onboard Marcus' ship is extremely valuable to us.  You'll need Marcus to transmit the data from his console before you can complete the rescue. | 
blackhole_part3_stargate2 | Losing that data will set the Stargate project back years. | 
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomea1 | We're really disappointed in your choices, Captain.  You've let us down and you've let the whole Stargate Project down, with your incredibly narrow thinking. | 
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomea2 | The data you received is so incomplete that is is rendered virtually useless.  There will be no further bonus from us. | 
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomeb1 | Well done on retrieving some of the data, Captain.  We would have preferred all of it, but we appreciate the rescue was under extreme duress. | 
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomeb2 | Our payment has been scaled accordingly with the volume of data received. | 
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomec1 | Congratulations, Captain, on successfully recovering the science data from the stricken vessel.  This data represents a huge step forward in our understanding of high energy physics, and will hugely accelerate the Stargate Program. | 
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomec2 | We're sorry to hear about the condition of Dr. Marcus Martinez.  In all honesty it is a miracle any rescue was even possible, given the circumstances. | 
blackhole_part3_stargateoutcomec3 | Please accept our payment as a sign of our gratitude. We look forward to continuing to work with you. |
