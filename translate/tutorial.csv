tutorial_surveyintro | We are going to learn how to survey the area around your ship.\n\nThe first step is to scan the local area of the sector surrounding you ship using a <b>SECTOR SCAN</b>.\n\nIn Boldly Go, only the new sector can be surveyed.\n\nHyperspace sensors are required to do this. | 
tutorial_surveylocalsurveyintro | The next step is to perform a <b>LOCAL SURVEY</b>.\n\nLocal surveys allow points of interest to be accessed via FTL.\n\nShips need to have super computers installed and must be in the same sector to participate in a local survey. | 
tutorial_surveyoutro | Click <b>NEXT</b> to speed-up the survey. | 
tutorial_surveystartlocalsurvey | Areas of interest will expire after some time if they are not surveyed. Multiple layers can contribute towards a local survey.\n\nClick on the point of interest to begin the local survey. | 
tutorial_surveystartsectorsurvey | Sector scans search for areas of interest in the sector around the system your ship is located in.\n\nThe scan will stop after it has completed. Only one layer in a system can do a sector scan.\n\nClick the button to begin a sector scan. | 
tutorial_surveysuccess | A new system on the sector map has appeared for your fleet to explore!\n\nWell done, you have now learnt how to use sector surveying to find and explore new systems.\n\nKeep an eye out for special loot on surveyed derelict ships that can be researched by your science stations. | 
tutorial_trade_title | TRADE | 
tutorial_tradebuyminerals | <b>METALLIC MINERALS</b> can be smelted into <b>METAL INGOTS</b> just like <b>SCRAP METAL</b>.\n\nAdd all the <b>METALLIC MINERALS</b> to the trade. | 
tutorial_tradebuymore | This is a good opportunity to stock up on some other resources that are critical for life support.\n\nWe'd recommend you purchase:\n\n - 2x <b>FUEL</b>\n - 2x <b>OXYGEN</b>\n - 2x <b>WATER</b>\n - 2x <b>FOOD</b>\n\n- <b>HIRE</b> 5 <b>MORE CREW</b>\n\nCONFIRM the order when you are done. | 
tutorial_tradebuysmelter | We will also need another <b>SMELTER</b> to begin processing those <b>METALLIC MINERALS</b>.\n\nFind the <b>SMELTER</b> under the <b>INDUSTRY</b> tab and add one to the order. | 
tutorial_tradeinstallsmelter | Once those goods have arrived, you should install your second <b>SMELTER</b> somewhere near the first. | 
tutorial_tradeothersupplies | We can use the <b>TRADE</b> system to buy raw materials to produce more <b>STARGATE FRAMES</b>, as well as resources we will need to survive.\n\nReopen the <b>TRADE</b> screen. | 
tutorial_tradesmeltmetallicminerals | Set the <b>SMELTER</b> to process those <b>METALLIC MINERALS</b> you bought into more <b>METAL INGOTS</b>. | 
tutorial_tradewaitforsellable | Your crew will now use the equipment to produce some <b>STARGATE FRAMES</b>. |
