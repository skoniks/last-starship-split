scienceobjective_accepted1 | We've designed a custom sensor package that will give us the information we need. | 
scienceobjective_accepted2 | A shuttle is on its way now with two of these sensors. | 
scienceobjective_award | SCIENCE AWARD | 
scienceobjective_capturedata | You have captured *X Data from the anomaly. | 
scienceobjective_description1 | We need more data so we can understand what this anomaly is. | 
scienceobjective_description2 | And we can't possibly stop the anomaly until we understand it. | 
scienceobjective_description3 | If you can gather enough science data for us, we think there's a good chance we can design a way to counteract the anomaly. | 
scienceobjective_funding | We can send you research funding as you collect data. Capture 10 data from the Anomaly and we'll send the first funding grant. | 
scienceobjective_installsensors | Install the sensors on your ship (*X/2) | 
scienceobjective_installsensors2 | Ensure the sensors are powered and operational | 
scienceobjective_milestone1a | We've received your preliminary sensor data. Fascinating! It looks like the anomaly is expanding, and the rate of expansion is increasing. | 
scienceobjective_milestone1b | We've just paid you a science grant of $10,000. Capture 100 data to unlock more funding. The closer you fly to the anomaly, the faster the sensors collect data. | 
scienceobjective_milestone2a | We've now received 100 science packets from your sensors, thank you. This is invaluable data for us. | 
scienceobjective_milestone2b | We've just sent you another $100,000.  The next bonus will be $1 Million for 1000 sensor data.  You can buy more hyperspace sensors at starbases and colonies. | 
scienceobjective_milestone3a | Your sensors have now captured 1000 data from the anomaly. We have our best minds working on a solution and your data has been invaluable. | 
scienceobjective_milestone3b | We're sending a $1M science grant to you now.  Keep doing what you're doing! More funding will be unlocked at 10,000 science data. | 
scienceobjective_milestone4a | 10,000 science data received. Payment $10M. | 
scienceobjective_milestone4b | Next bonus at 100,000 science data | 
scienceobjective_nextbonus | Next bonus for *X Captured data : $*Y. | 
scienceobjective_receivedsensors1 | Both sensors are on board your ship. You need to install them. | 
scienceobjective_scientist | Research Institute | 
scienceobjective_sensorsinstalled | Sensors Installed | 
scienceobjective_success | Captured *X Data | 
scienceobjective_successbonus | Captured *X Data. Funding bonus $*Y. | 
scienceobjective_title | SPECIAL MISSION: ANALYSE ANOMALY | 
scienceobjective_usesensors1 | These sensors will collect data from the anomaly while you are in Hyperspace. | 
scienceobjective_usesensors2 | The closer you can hyperjump to the anomaly, the faster they will collect data. |
