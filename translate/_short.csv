calltoarms_harken_1 | Captain, I'm the chief of security for this sector, and I need your help. | 
calltoarms_harken_2 | All across the sector, there are people in trouble who need our assistance. | 
calltoarms_harken_3 | I'm spread too thin. I can't be everywhere. You're more than capable, and I'll be there to offer advice when I can. | 
calltoarms_harken_4 | If you chose to help, I've marked the locations on your map, as GOLD HIGHLIGHTS. | 
calltoarms_harken_5 | Thank you, Captain. | 
calltoarms_harkenrailroad_1 | My name is Commander Harken, and I'm the Chief of Private Security for the sector. | 
calltoarms_harkenrailroad_2 | There is a crisis underway, Captain.  Commercial vessels are going missing, all across the sector.  I suspect foul play, and I need your help to investigate. | 
calltoarms_harkenrailroad_3 | We've recieved reports of a shipwreck nearby. I believe it to be the wreckage of THE INTERSTELLAR PROSPECTOR - a large commercial vessel that went missing yesterday. | 
calltoarms_harkenrailroad_4 | Travel to the shipwreck and look for a Black Box Flight Recorder in the wreckage.  This device will contain a log of their final moments. | 
calltoarms_harkenrailroad_5 | To collect the flight recorder you'll need to install a DRONE BAY and at least one LOGISTICS DRONE. You can buy them from any Shipyard or Colony. | 
calltoarms_harkenrailroad_6 | I've marked the location of the shipwreck on your map as a Gold Highlight.  Good luck, Captain. |

opentextcrawl_5 | Those who live nearby call it THE COLLAPSE, and believe it will eventually consume the entire galaxy. | 
opentextcrawl_6 | There are few who believe them. | 
opentextcrawl_7 | Nevertheless, Earth has dispatched you and your crew in the science vessel PRAXIS to investigate. |
